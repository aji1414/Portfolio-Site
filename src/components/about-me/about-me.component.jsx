        Hey, my name is Aji (or AJ). I am a former actuary - turned data analyst -
        turned English teacher - and last but not least - software developer <strong>(my true calling!!!)</strong>.
        I design and build functional and eye catching web applications through
        carefully crafted code and user - centric design.

            I love nothing more than diving into a new language/framework
            and solving problem after problem. Whether it's building user
            friendly front end designs, or managing complex data flow 
            on the backend, I welcome all challenges!
